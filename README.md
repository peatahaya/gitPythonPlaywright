<h2>Python Testing with Playwright and Pytest</h2>

This project demonstrates how to use Playwright and Pytest for automated 
web testing in Python. Playwright, a powerful browser automation tool 
from Microsoft, allows for fast and reliable end-to-end testing across 
multiple browsers. Combined with Pytest, a robust testing framework, 
this setup provides a comprehensive solution for testing modern web 
applications.
